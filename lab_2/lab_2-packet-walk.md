# Lab 2: SRv6 uSID Packet Walk [5 Min]

### Description: 
This is a supplemental lab guide used to deconstruct the forwarding process of traffic through the SRv6 lab topology in this lab. In Lab 2 we are setting up the SRv6 underlay and enabling SRv6 encapsulation of IPv4 traffic in the global forwarding table or default VRF. This is distinct from Lab 3 where we will add the virtualization concept of L3VPN + SRv6.

## Lab Objectives
The student upon completion of Lab 2 should have achieved the following objectives:

* Understand how standard IPv4 or IPv6 packets are encapsulated with SRv6 headers
* Understand the forwarding behavior of SRv6 enabled routers
* Understand how SRv6 routers decapsulate and forward traffic as an IPv4 or IPv6 packet
* Understand how IPv6 only routers can participate in SRv6 networks.

## Packet Walk Results for traffic from Amsterdam to Rome over SRv6

The expected results of a packet capture on **xrd01** is to see ICMP IPv4 traffic sourced from **Amsterdam (10.101.2.1)** to a loopback interface on **Rome (20.0.0.1)** use SRv6 encapsulation across the network.

See results below and notice both the ICMP echo and ICMP echo reply packets with SRv6 encapsulation. 
> [!NOTE]
>  In this example the egress and return traffic both happened to be hashed through **xrd02**.
>  Path selection using the global routing table as you will see in the detailed packet walk below
>  has multiple ECMP path options.

1. First SSH to the Amsterdam VM then start a ping to the Rome VM
```
ssh cisco@198.18.128.102
ping 20.0.0.1 -i 1
```

2. Then on the XRD host VM run tcpdump to capture SRv6 encapsulated traffic egressing **xrd01**. We don't know which interface the traffic will be hashed through so we may need to run tcpdump on both interfaces. Note, the tcpdump output may not show until you stop it with crtl-z.
```
sudo ip netns exec clab-cleu25-xrd01 tcpdump -lni Gi0-0-0-1
sudo ip netns exec clab-cleu25-xrd01 tcpdump -lni Gi0-0-0-2
```

Example output:
```
cisco@xrd:~/SRv6_dCloud_Lab/lab_2$ sudo ip netns exec clab-cleu25-xrd01 tcpdump -lni Gi0-0-0-1
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on Gi0-0-0-1, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
^C01:54:41.418301 IP6 fc00:0:1111::1 > fc00:0:7777:e005::: IP 10.101.2.1 > 20.0.0.1: ICMP echo request, id 4, seq 11, length 64
01:54:41.421606 IP6 fc00:0:7777::1 > fc00:0:1111:e005::: IP 20.0.0.1 > 10.101.2.1: ICMP echo reply, id 4, seq 11, length 64
01:54:41.818159 IP6 fc00:0:1111::1 > fc00:0:7777:e005::: IP 10.101.2.1 > 20.0.0.1: ICMP echo request, id 4, seq 12, length 64
01:54:41.821777 IP6 fc00:0:7777::1 > fc00:0:1111:e005::: IP 20.0.0.1 > 10.101.2.1: ICMP echo reply, id 4, seq 12, length 64
```
3. To see the encapsulated traffic further in the network you can tcpdump links on **xrd02**, **xrd05**, etc. Examples:
```
sudo ip netns exec clab-cleu25-xrd02 tcpdump -lni Gi0-0-0-1
sudo ip netns exec clab-cleu25-xrd05 tcpdump -lni Gi0-0-0-1

sudo ip netns exec clab-cleu25-xrd03 tcpdump -lni Gi0-0-0-1
sudo ip netns exec clab-cleu25-xrd04 tcpdump -lni Gi0-0-0-1
etc.
```

### SRv6 Encapsulation and BGP

In the above **xrd01** recieves IPv4 packets from Amsterdam destined to Rome. We will walk through the process of determining that SRv6 encapsulation is required and lookup process.

1. From **xrd01** we can see a lookup of the IPv4 DA address in the bgpv4 global routing table and the SRv6 SID associated with the route 20.0.0.0/24.
  ```
  show ip bgp ipv4 unicast 20.0.0.0/24
  ```

  Example truncated output:
  ```
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:xrd01#show bgp ipv4 unicast 20.0.0.0/24
  Wed Jan 15 07:05:49.623 UTC

          SubSubTLV:

2. Lookup of fc00:0:7777:e005::/48 the in the global IPv6 routing table.
  ```
  show route ipv6 fc00:0:7777:e005::
  ```

  Output:
  ```

2. Lets now lookup in the CEF table to see the forwarding next hop.
  ```
  show ip cef 20.0.0.0/24
  ```

  Output:
