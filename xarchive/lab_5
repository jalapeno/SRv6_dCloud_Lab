## Lab 5: Exploring Jalapeno, Kafka, and ArangoDB [30 Min]

### Description
In Lab 5 we will explore elements of the Jalapeno system. We will log into the Kafka container and monitor topics for data coming in from Jalapeno's data collectors. Data which is subsequently picked up by Jalapeno's data processors and written to the Arango graphDB. We will spend some time getting familiar with ArangoDB and the Jalapeno data collections, and will run some basic queries. Lastly we will populate the graphDB with some synthetic data and run a number of complex queries including graph traversals.

## Kafka
### Kafka Intro
From the Kafka [homepage](https://kafka.apache.org/): Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications.

Jalapeno uses Kafka as a message bus between its data collectors and data processors. Jalapeno's data collectors create Kafka topics then publish their datasets to those topics. The data processors subscribe to the relevant Kafka topics, gather the published data, and write it to either the Arango graphDB or Influx Time-Series DB. This `Collector -> Kafka -> Processor -> DB` pipeline allows for architectural flexibility and extensibility such that other applications could subscribe to the Jalapeno Kafka topics and use the BMP or telemetry data for their own purposes.

Kafka has a number of built in command line utilities to do things like listing topics or outputting of topic data to the screen, which we'll do in the next section of the lab. 

For additional help on Kafka see this external CLI cheat sheet [HERE](https://medium.com/@TimvanBaarsen/apache-kafka-cli-commands-cheat-sheet-a6f06eac01b)


### Kafka Topics 

1. In a separate terminal session ssh to the Jalapeno VM 
    ```
    cisco@198.18.128.101
    pw = cisco123
    ```

2. Login to the Kafka container and cd into the bin directory. 
    ```
    kubectl exec -it kafka-0 -n jalapeno -- /bin/bash

    cd bin
    ls -la
    ```

3. The Jalapeno deployment of Kakfa includes enablement of JMX (Java Management Extensions), which allows for monitoring of Kafka elements such as brokers, topics, Zookeeper, etc. To operate the CLI utilies we'll need to unset the JMX_PORT:  
    ```
    unset JMX_PORT
    ```

4. Run the CLI utility to get a listing of all Kafka topics in our cluster:
    ```
    ./kafka-topics.sh --list  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
    ```
    - A few seconds after running the *--list* command you should see the following list of topics toward the bottom on the command output:
    ```
    gobmp.parsed.evpn
    gobmp.parsed.evpn_events
    gobmp.parsed.flowspec
    gobmp.parsed.flowspec_events
    gobmp.parsed.flowspec_v4

    ```

### Monitoring a Kafka topic

The *`kafka-console-consumer.sh`* utility allows one to manually monitor a given topic and see messages as they are published by the GoBMP collector. This gives us a nice troubleshooting tool for scenarios where a router may be sending data to the collector, but the data is not seen in the DB.

In the next set of steps we'll run the CLI to monitor a Kafka topic and watch for data from GoBMP. GoBMP's topics are fairly quiet unless BGP updates are happening, so once we have our monitoring session up we'll clear BGP-LS on the RR, which should result in a flood of data onto the topic.

In this exercise we are going to stitch together several elements that we have worked on throughout this lab. The routers in our lab have a number of topology-relevant configurations, including several that we've added over the course of labs 1 - 4. We will use the tools to examine how that data is communicated through the network and ultimately collected and populated into Jalapeno's DB.

#### ISIS Link State
   1. Monitor the BGP-LS *`ls_node`* Kafka topic for incoming BMP messages describing ISIS nodes in the network:

        ```
        ./kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092  --topic gobmp.parsed.ls_node
        ```

        Optional - enable terminal monitoring and debugging the of BGP-LS address family on one of the route reflectors such as **xrd05**:
        ```
        terminal monitor
        debug bgp update afi link-state link-state in
        ```
        - Fair warning: this will output quite a bit of data when the AFI is cleared
        
   2. Connect to **xrd01** and clear the BGP-LS address family
        ```
        clear bgp link-state link-state * soft
        ```

        On the Kafka console we expect to see 14 json objects representing BMP messages when we perform a soft reset of the BGP session in **xrd01**. This will cause router **xrd01** to repopulate it's ISIS node data which is then mirrored to the BGP route reflectors. Below is one of the records received through BMP by Jalapeno and sent through the Kafka bus for **xrd01** own ISIS link state node record.

        ```json
        {
            "action": "add",

                    }

            "sr_local_block": {
                "flags": 0,
                "subranges": [
                    {
                        "range_size": 1000,
                        "label": 15000
                    }
                ]
            },
            "srv6_capabilities_tlv": {
                "o_flag": false
            },
            "node_msd": [
                {
                    "msd_type": 1,
                    "msd_value": 10
                }
            ],
            "is_prepolicy": false,
            "is_adj_rib_in": false
        }
        ```
#### SRv6 Locator SID    
   1. Now lets examine the SRv6 locator configuration on **xrd01** with the command: show run segment-routing srv6 locators 
        ```  
        show run segment-routing srv6 locators
        ```
        ```
        segment-routing
        srv6
        locators
            locator MyLocator
            micro-segment behavior unode psp-usd
            prefix fc00:0:1111::/48     <----- xrd01 SRv6 locator defined
        ```

   4. With **xrd01** SID locator identified lets see how that is communicated through the BMP from the route reflectors.
      Monitor the BGP-LS *`ls_srv6_sid`* topic for incoming BMP messages describing SRv6 SIDs in the network:  

      Use ctrl-z to kill the previous kafka console monitor then:
       ```
       ./kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092  --topic gobmp.parsed.ls_srv6_sid
       ```

       Optional - enable terminal monitoring and debugging the of BGP-LS address family on one of the route reflectors such as **xrd05**:  

       ```
       terminal monitor
       debug bgp update afi vpnv6 unicast in
       ```
       *Fair warning: this will output quite a bit of data when the bgp is cleared*

   5. Again on **xrd01** clear the BGP-LS address family
       ```
       clear bgp link-state link-state * soft
       ```

       One the Kafka console we expect to see 14 json objects representing BMP messages coming from our 2 route reflectors and describing our 7 different ISIS nodes. Example messages:
       ```json
       {
           "action": "add",
           "router_hash": "0669df0f031fb83e345267a9679bbc6a",
           "router_ip": "10.0.0.5",   <---- Reporting router
           "domain_id": 0,
           "peer_hash": "ef9f1cc86e4617df24d4675e2b55bbe2",
           "peer_ip": "10.0.0.1",     <---- Source router
           "peer_asn": 65000,
           "timestamp": "2023-01-13T19:49:01.000764233Z",

               "o_flag": false,
               "a_flag": false,
               "mt_id": 2
           },
           "igp_flags": 0,
           "is_prepolicy": false,
           "is_adj_rib_in": false,
           "srv6_sid": "fc00:0:1111::",   <---- xrd01 loactor SID
           "srv6_endpoint_behavior": {
               "endpoint_behavior": 48,
               "flag": 0,
               "algo": 0
           },
           "srv6_sid_structure": {
               "locator_block_length": 32,
               "locator_node_length": 16,
               "function_length": 0,
               "argument_length": 80
           }
       }
       ```

### Arango GraphDB

1. Switch to a web browser and connect to Jalapeno's Arango GraphDB
    ```
    http://198.18.128.101:30852/
    ```
    ```
    user: root
    password: jalapeno
    DB: jalapeno
    ```
2. Spend some time exploring the data collections in the DB

    #### Basic queries to explore data collections 
    The ArangoDB Query Language (AQL) can be used to retrieve and modify data that are stored in ArangoDB.

    The general workflow when executing a query is as follows:

    - A client application ships an AQL query to the ArangoDB server. The query text contains everything ArangoDB needs to compile the result set

    - ArangoDB will parse the query, execute it and compile the results. If the query is invalid or cannot be executed, the server will return an error that the client can process and react to. If the query can be executed successfully, the server will return the query results (if any) to the client. See ArangoDB documentation [HERE](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/aql/index.html)


3. Run some DB Queries (one the left side of the Arango UI click on Queries):
    
    For the most basic query below *x* is a object variable with each key field in a record populated as a child object. So basic syntax can be thought of as:

    *`for x in <collection_name> return x `*

    ```
    for x in ls_node return x
    ```
    This query will return ALL records in the *`ls_node`* collection. In our lab topology you should expect 7 records. 

     - Note: after running a query you will need to either comment it out or delete it before running the next query. To comment-out use two forward slashes *`//`* as shown in this pic:

    <img src="images/arango-query.png" width="600">

    Next lets get the AQL to return only the *`key:value`* field we are interested in. We will query the name of all nodes in the *`igp_node`* collection with the below query. To reference a specific key field we use use the format **x.key** syntax.
    ```
    for x in igp_node return x.name
    ```
    Expected output from Arango query:
    ```   
    "xrd01",
    "xrd02",
    "xrd03",
    "xrd04",
    "xrd05",
    "xrd06",
    "xrd07"
    ```
    If we wish to return multiple keys in our query we will switch to using curly braces to ask for a data set in the return. In this case we are quering the name to return the record only for **xrd01**
    ```
    for x in igp_node 
        filter x.name == "xrd04"
    return {Name: x.name, SID: x.sids}
    ```

    Truncated output:
    ```
    {
        "Name": "xrd04",
        "SID": [
        {
            "srv6_sid": "fc00:0:4444::",
            "srv6_endpoint_behavior": {
            "endpoint_behavior": 48,
            "flag": 0,
            "algo": 0
            },
            "srv6_sid_structure": {
            "locator_block_length": 32,
            "locator_node_length": 16,
            "function_length": 0,
            "argument_length": 80
            }
        }
        ]
    }
    ```

    Now if you want to filter on multiple conditions we can through a boolean value in to return the **xrd01** and **xrd07** records.
    ```
    for x in igp_node 
        filter x.name == "xrd01" or x.name=="xrd07"
    return {Name: x.name, SID: x.sids}
    ```

4. Optional or for reference: feel free to try a number of additional queries in the lab_5-queries.md doc [Here](https://github.com/jalapeno/SRv6_dCloud_Lab/tree/main/lab_5/lab_5-queries.md)
    
 
### Populating the DB with external data 

The *`add_meta_data.py`* python script will connect to the ArangoDB and populate elements in our data collections with addresses and country codes. Also, due to the fact that we can't run realistic traffic through the XRd topology the script will populate the relevant graphDB elements with synthetic link latency and outbound link utilization data per this diagram:

<img src="/topo_drawings/path-latency-topology.png" width="900">


1. Return to the ssh session on the Jalapeno VM and add meta data to the DB. Note, if your Jalapeno VM session is still attached to Kakfa, type *`'ctrl-z'`* then type *`'exit'`*:
   ```
   cd ~/SRv6_dCloud_Lab/lab_5/python/
   python3 add_meta_data.py
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   cisco@jalapeno:~/SRv6_dCloud_Lab/lab_5/python$ python3 add_meta_data.py
   adding addresses, country codes, and synthetic latency data to the graph
   adding location, country codes, latency, and link utilization data
   meta data added
   ```

2. Validate meta data with an ArangoDB query:
   ```
   for x in ipv4_graph return { key: x._key, from: x._from, to: x._to, latency: x.latency, 
    utilization: x.percent_util_out, country_codes: x.country_codes }
   ```
> [!NOTE]
> Only the ISIS links in the DB have latency and utilization numbers. The Amsterdam and Rome VMs are directly connected to PEs **xrd01** and **xrd07**, so their "edge connections" in the DB are effectively zero latency. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> The *`add_meta_data.py`* script has also populated country codes for all the countries a given link traverses from one node to its adjacent peer. Example: **xrd01** is in Amsterdam, and **xrd02** is in Berlin. Thus the **xrd01** <--> **xrd02** link traverses *`[NLD, DEU]`*

3. Run the *`get_nodes.py`* script to get a listing of nodes in the network, their addresses, and SRv6 SID data:
   ```
   cd ~/SRv6_dCloud_Lab/lab_5/python/
   python3 get_nodes.py
   cat nodes.json
   ```

### Arango Graph traversals and shortest path queries
General Arango AQL graph query syntax information [HERE](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/aql/graphs.html)

#### Shortest Path Query
One of the great things about a GraphDB is it gives us a "shortest path" algorithm out of the box. This type of query will find the shortest path between two given vertex *`(startVertex and targetVertex)`* elements in your graph. In our case the shortest path between two different nodes in the graph's representation of our network. 
Reference this document on the shortest path algorithim in AQL [HERE](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/aql/graphs-shortest-path.html) (2 minute read). 

   1. Return to the ArangoDB browser UI and run a shortest path query from **xrd01** to **xrd07**, and have it return SRv6 SID data.
   ```
   for v, e in outbound shortest_path 'igp_node/2_0_0_0000.0000.0001' 
        TO 'igp_node/2_0_0_0000.0000.0007' ipv4_graph 
        return  { node: v.name, location: v.location_id, address: v.address, srv6sid: v.sids[*].srv6_sid }
   ```
   - Note: In the graphDB the **xrd01** and **xrd07** nodes are represented as:
  
     - 'igp_node/2_0_0_0000.0000.0001'
     - 'igp_node/2_0_0_0000.0000.0007'

   #### For all the remaining queries in this lab you can run the query against the return path by simply reversing the startVertex and targetVertex. Example where xrd07 and xrd01 are reversed:

   ```
   for v, e in outbound shortest_path 'igp_node/2_0_0_0000.0000.0007' 
        TO 'igp_node/2_0_0_0000.0000.0001' ipv4_graph 
        return  { node: v.name, location: v.location_id, address: v.address, srv6sid: v.sids[*].srv6_sid }
   ```

   1. Next we can expand the diameter of our query. In this case its no longer just ingress router to egress router, its a shortest path query from source prefix (Amsterdam VM) to destination prefix (Rome VM). This example query also includes hop by hop latency:
   ```
   for v, e in outbound shortest_path 'unicast_prefix_v4/10.101.2.0_24_10.0.0.1' 
        TO 'unicast_prefix_v4/20.0.0.0_24_10.0.0.7' ipv4_graph 
        return  { node: v.name, location: v.location_id, address: v.address, 
        srv6sid: v.sids[*].srv6_sid, latency: e.latency }
   ```

   Thus far all of these shortest path query results are based purely on hop count, which is fine, however, the graphDB also allows us to run a *`weighted shortest path query`* based on any metric or other piece of meta data in the graph!

### Shortest path queries using metrics other than hop count

#### Query for the lowest latency path between Amsterdam and Rome:
   ```
   for v, e in outbound shortest_path 'unicast_prefix_v4/10.101.1.0_24_10.0.0.1' 
        TO 'unicast_prefix_v4/20.0.0.0_24_10.0.0.7' ipv4_graph OPTIONS {weightAttribute: 'latency' } 
        return  { prefix: v.prefix, name: v.name, srv6sid: v.sids[*].srv6_sid, latency: e.latency }
   ```

### Graph Traversals
A traversal starts at one specific document *`(startVertex)`* and follows all edges connected to this document using min depth and max depth values, or in network-engineer-speak, find all paths between *`Source`* and *`Destination`* with a *`minimum hop count of X and maximum hop count of Y`*.

ArangoDB reference [LINK](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/aql/graphs-traversals-explained.html)

Basically for our purposes we can use Graph Traversal to find all paths that satisfy a given set of constraints including minimum and maximum hops to consider.

#### Query for the least utilized path
Backups, data replication, other bulk transfers can oftentimes take a non-best path through the network. In theory the *`least utilized path`* could be many hops in length, so we're going to include a notation **(1..6)** which indicates the query can consider paths with 6 or fewer hops.
    
   1. First a query for full path data. We expect to see the Arango UI render a topology that includes all seven routers and our two prefix endpoints:

   ```
   FOR v, e, p in 1..6 outbound 'unicast_prefix_v4/10.101.1.0_24_10.0.0.1' ipv4_graph 
       options {uniqueVertices: "path", bfs: true} filter v._id == 'unicast_prefix_v4/20.0.0.0_24_10.0.0.7' 
       return distinct p
   ```
   
   2. Optional: try the same query, but limit results to 5 hops or fewer:
   ```
   FOR v, e, p in 1..5 outbound 'unicast_prefix_v4/10.101.1.0_24_10.0.0.1' ipv4_graph 
       options {uniqueVertices: "path", bfs: true} filter v._id == 'unicast_prefix_v4/20.0.0.0_24_10.0.0.7' 
       return distinct p
   ```
   The resulting graph leaves out the longest path through the network:

   <img src="images/graph-traversal-5-hops.png" width="600">

   3. Run the same query but with filtered output. 
   ```
   for v, e, p in 1..6 outbound 'unicast_prefix_v4/10.101.1.0_24_10.0.0.1' ipv4_graph 
       options {uniqueVertices: "path", bfs: true} filter v._id == 'unicast_prefix_v4/20.0.0.0_24_10.0.0.7' 
       return distinct { path: p.vertices[*].name, sid: p.vertices[*].sids[*].srv6_sid, countries_traversed: p.edges[*].country_codes[*], latency: sum(p.edges[*].latency), percent_util_out: avg(p.edges[*].percent_util_out)} 
   ```
   We no longer see the UI render a topology, but we do get a nice subset of the output data. Also note the *return* instruction in the query specifies that it should add up the `latency` values, and do an average calculation on `percent_util_out` values.
    
   - Note: the least utilized path should be **xrd01** -> **xrd02** -> **xrd03** -> **xrd04** -> **xrd07**. This also happens to be the longest path geographically in our network (Netherlands proceeding east and south through Germany, Poland, Ukraine, Turkey, etc.). Any traffic taking this path will be subject to the longest latency in our network. 

   The previous queries provided paths up to 5 or 6-hops in length. We can increase or decrease the number of hops a graph traversal may use. For example we could increase the length of the traversal such that paths of up to 8 hops will be considered:
   
   ```
    for v, e, p in 1..8 outbound 'unicast_prefix_v4/10.101.1.0_24_10.0.0.1' ipv4_graph 
        options {uniqueVertices: "path", bfs: true} filter v._id == 'unicast_prefix_v4/20.0.0.0_24_10.0.0.7' 
        return distinct { path: p.vertices[*].name, sid: p.vertices[*].sids[*].srv6_sid, 
        country_list: p.edges[*].country_codes[*], latency: sum(p.edges[*].latency), 
        percent_util_out: avg(p.edges[*].percent_util_out)}

   ```
   - Note: the graph traversal is inherently loop-free (*another win for the GraphDB!*). If you increase the previous query to a max of 10 or 12 hops it should return the same number of results as the 1..8 query because there are no more loop-free paths.

### K Shortest Paths
This type of query finds the first **k** paths in order of length (or weight) between two given documents - the startVertex and targetVertex in your graph.

#### A Data sovereignty query

1. We'll use the *`K Shortest Paths`* query method to find one or more suitable paths from Amsterdam to Rome that avoids France:

 - First a query for full path data:
    ```
    for p in outbound k_shortest_paths  'unicast_prefix_v4/10.101.2.0_24_10.0.0.1' to 
        'unicast_prefix_v4/20.0.0.0_24_10.0.0.7' ipv4_graph options {uniqueVertices: "path"} 
        filter p.edges[*].country_codes !like "%FRA%" return distinct p
    ```
  The resulting graph shows our two paths that avoid going through France *(xrd06 in Paris)*
  <img src="images/data-sovereignty-query.png" width="600">

 - We can run the same query but with filtered output:
    ```
    for p in outbound k_shortest_paths 'unicast_prefix_v4/10.101.2.0_24_10.0.0.1' to 'unicast_prefix_v4/20.0.0.0_24_10.0.0.7' ipv4_graph filter p.edges[*].country_codes !like "%FRA%" return distinct { path: p.vertices[*].name, 
            sid: p.vertices[*].sids[*].srv6_sid, countries_traversed: p.edges[*].country_codes[*], latency: sum(p.edges[*].latency), percent_util_out: avg(p.edges[*].percent_util_out)}
    ```

   - The results in the query response should not traverse any links containing the *`FRA`* country code

   - Optional: feel free to run queries to `avoid` other countries as well. Just replace *`FRA`* in the query string with any of these country codes:  *`GBR`*, *`DEU`*, *`BRU`*, *`POL`*, *`TUR`*, *`UKR`*, *`MDA`*, *`BGR`*, *`AUT`*, *`HUN`*, *`SRB`*. You'll notice interesting results on some queries where the *xrd05 - xrd04* link traverses many countries.
